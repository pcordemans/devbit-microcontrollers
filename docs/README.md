## Course goals

Upon completion of this course one should be able to:

* Build microcontroller-based embedded systems & applications.
* Apply theoretical & practical knowledge of the microprocessor internal operation.
* Apply theoretical & practical knowledge of microcontroller peripherals, such as Timers, ADC, DAC, PWM. 
* Apply theoretical & practical knowledge of common microcontroller interfaces, i.e. UART, SPI, IÂ²C.
* Apply theoretical & practical knowledge of writing embedded software

## Approach

1. Learn the internals of the microcontroller and program on the register level.
1. Build embedded applications using a prototyping board and libraries.

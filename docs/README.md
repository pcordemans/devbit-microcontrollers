## Course goals

Upon completion of this course one should be able to:

* Build microcontroller-based embedded systems & applications.
* Apply theoretical & practical knowledge of the microprocessor internal operation.
* Apply theoretical & practical knowledge of microcontroller peripherals, such as Timers, ADC, DAC, PWM. 
* Apply theoretical & practical knowledge of common microcontroller interfaces, i.e. UART, SPI, I²C.
* Apply theoretical & practical knowledge of writing embedded software

## Course approach

1. Learn the internals of the STM32L476RGT6 microcontroller and program it on the register level.
1. Build embedded applications using the Nucleo L476RG prototyping board and mbed libraries.
